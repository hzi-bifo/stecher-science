######################################### DATA CLEANING
# This script is used for cleaning the feature table, an output of metabolomics 
# experiment, containing all the features with their corresponding intensities.
# The data cleanup steps involved are: 
# 1) Splitting the data into Blank/Sample
# 2) Blank Removal (data subtraction)
# 3) Filtering of features
# 4) Normalization by weight
# 5) Remove bad injections
# 6) Imputation 
# 7) Normalization (quantile and total area)

### 1) Feature table: An output of metabolomics experiment, containing all the 
# features or peaks (LC-MS peaks here) with their corresponding intensities. 
# Ex: The feature table used in the test data is obtained by MZmine or MPP. (Filetype: .csv file)
### 2) Metadata: Created by the user about the files used obtaining the feature 
# table (It can be a csv/txt/tsv file). The columns in a metadata should be created
# with the following format: filename (1st column having all the filenames in 
# the same order as the columns in feature table), all the other columns with 
# column name such as: ATTRIBUTE_yourDesiredAttribute.

##################################################################################
#########################################  STEP 2) Blank Removal
#  LC-MS/MS, we use solvents called Blanks which are usually injected time-to-time
# to prevent carryover of the sample. The features coming from these Blanks would also be detected by LC-MS/MS instrument. Our goal here is to remove these features from our samples. The other blanks that can be removed are: Signals coming from growth media alone in terms of microbial growth experiment, signals from the solvent used for extraction methods and so on. Therefore, it is best practice to measure mass spectra of these blanks as well in addition to your sample spectra.
# How do we remove these blank features?
# Since we have the feature table split into Control blanks and Sample groups now,
# we can compare blanks to the sample to identify the background features coming
# from blanks. A common filtering method is to use a cutoff to remove features 
# that are not present sufficient enough in our biological samples.

# The steps followed in the next few cells are:
## 1) We find an average for all the feature intensities in your blank set and 
# sample set. Therefore, for n no.of features in a blank or sample set, we get 
# n no.of averaged features.
## 2) Next, we get a ratio of this average_blanks vs average_sample. This ratio 
# Blank/sample tells us how much of that particular feature of a sample gets its
# contribution from blanks. If it is more than 30% (or Cutoff as 0.3), we consider
# the feature as noise.
## 3) The resultant information (if ratio > Cutoff or not) is stored in a bin such 
# as 1 = Noise or background signal, 0 = Feature Signal
## 4) We count the no.of features in the bin that satisfies the condition ratio > 
# cutoff, and consider those features as 'noise or background features' and remove them.

#When cutoff is low, more noise (or background) detected; With higher cutoff, less background detected, thus more features observed
#Cutoff <- as.numeric(readline('Enter Cutoff value between 0.1 & 1:')) # (i.e. 10% - 100%). Ideal cutoff range: 0.1-0.3
Cutoff <-0.2

#Getting mean for every feature in blank and Samples
Avg_blank <- rowMeans(Blank, na.rm= FALSE, dims = 1) # set na.rm = FALSE to check if there are NA values. When set as TRUE, NA values are changed to 0
Avg_samples <- rowMeans(Samples, na.rm= FALSE, dims = 1)

#Getting the ratio of blank vs Sample
Ratio_blank_Sample <- (Avg_blank+1)/(Avg_samples+1)

# Creating a bin with 1s when the ratio>Cutoff, else put 0s
Bg_bin <- ifelse(Ratio_blank_Sample > Cutoff, 1, 0 )
Blank_removal <- cbind(Samples,Bg_bin)

# Checking if there are any NA values present. Having NA values in the 4 variables will affect the final dataset to be created

Blank_removal <- Blank_removal %>% filter(Bg_bin == 0) # Taking only the feature signals
Blank_removal <- as.matrix(Blank_removal[,-ncol(Blank_removal)]) # removing the last column Bg_bin

######################################### STEP 4) Imputation
# For several reasons, real world datasets might have some missing values in it,
# in the form of NA, NANs or 0s. Eventhough the gapfilling step of MZmine fills 
# the missing values, we still end up with some missing values or 0s in our 
# feature table. This could be problematic for statistical analysis.
# In order to have a better dataset, we cannot simply discard those rows or 
# columns with missing values as we will lose a chunk of our valuable data. 
# Instead we can try imputing those missing values. Imputation involves replacing
# the missing values in the data with a meaningful, reasonable guess. There are 
# several methods, such as:

## 1) Mean imputation (replacing the missing values in a column with the mean or
# average of the column)
## 2) Replacing it with the most frquent value
## 3) Several other machine learning imputation methods such as k-nearest neighbors
# algorithm(k-NN), Hidden Markov Model(HMM)
